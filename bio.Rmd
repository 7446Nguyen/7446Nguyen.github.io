I am an aspiring Data Scientist that leverages data to deliver concise data driven story telling and actionable insights. I joined the SMU MSDS program to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and applied practices of data science techniques.  I'm excited to be in this program and hope to apply this new knowledge to my work!
