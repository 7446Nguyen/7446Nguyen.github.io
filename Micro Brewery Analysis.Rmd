# Import and clean data
The data for this project was provided by officials from Budweiser brewing company

## Import data
Two data files Beers and Breweries are used in this analysis

```{r ImportData}

# Get raw data (Will Vary on Source Location)
Beers <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Jeff Nguyen\\Desktop\\MSDS\\Data Science\\6306_Project1\\Beers.csv")
Breweries <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Jeff Nguyen\\Desktop\\MSDS\\Data Science\\6306_Project1\\Breweries.csv")
```

## Clean Data
Data was examined for missing and duplicate values Cleaning data took the place in several steps

### Duplicate breweries
Two duplicate breweries were found, Summit Brewing Company of St Paul, MN and Sly Fox Brewing Company of Phoenxiville, PA. Beers related to one of the removed breweries were reassigned to the other brewery
```{r DuplicateBreweries}
# Fix duplicate Breweries, Just assign all Beers to one of the duplicates
#Breweries %>% filter(Breweries$Name=="Summit Brewing Company")
Beers[Beers$Brewery_id == 139,]$Brewery_id <- 59

#Breweries %>% filter(Breweries$Name=="Sly Fox Brewing Company")
Beers[Beers$Brewery_id == 164,]$Brewery_id <- 372

# Remove duplicate brewery
Breweries <- Breweries[!(Breweries$Brew_ID == 139 | Breweries$Brew_ID == 164),]
```
### Unique Beers
Several beers were duplicated in the provided data. A unique set of beers was created. For the purposes of this analysis beer name and brewery id are assumed to be unique
```{r DuplicateBeers, message=FALSE}
UniqueBeers <- Beers %>% group_by(Name,Brewery_id) %>% summarize(minBeer_ID = min(Beer_ID)) %>% select(minBeer_ID)

Beers <- inner_join(Beers, UniqueBeers, by = c("Beer_ID" = "minBeer_ID")) %>%
  select(Name = Name.x, Beer_ID, ABV, IBU, Brewery_id, Style, Ounces)
```
# Analysis Questions
Questions 1,3,4,5,6,7 answered below

## Question 1 : How many breweries are in each state?
```{r Question1}
BreweriesByState <- Breweries %>% select(State) %>% group_by(State) %>% count()
#head(BreweriesByState, 51)
firstBreweries = BreweriesByState[1:17,]
secondBreweries = BreweriesByState[18:34,]
thirdBreweries = BreweriesByState[35:51,]
BreweriesByStateWD <- cbind(firstBreweries,secondBreweries,thirdBreweries)
knitr::kable(BreweriesByStateWD,
             format = "html",
             caption = "Breweries by State",
             col.names = c("State","Brewery Count","State","Brewery Count","State","Brewery Count")) %>% 
  column_spec(1:6, width = "1.1in") %>% 
  row_spec(1:17,align = "center") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover"))

```
```{r OtherDataByStateCity, include=FALSE}
BreweriesByStateDesc <- BreweriesByState %>% arrange(desc(n))
#BreweriesByCity
BreweriesByCity <- Breweries %>% select(State,City) %>% group_by(State,City) %>% count()
BreweriesByCityDesc <- BreweriesByCity %>% arrange(desc(n))

```
## Question 2 : Data from Beers and Breweries was joined together
```{r JoinBeerBrewery, include=FALSE}
#### AQ 2 ####
BeerAndBrewery <- Breweries %>% inner_join(Beers, by = c("Brew_ID" = "Brewery_id"))
```
## Question 3 : Addressing missing data values
62 beers are missing ABV content and 990 beers are missing IBU rating. Mean ABV and IBU data for beers computed by style will be substituted for the missing data

### Compute Mean ABV by Style
```{r Question3ABVStyle}
# Get tables of Mean ABV and IBU by Style. Use those values to replace NA data
ABVByStyle <- Beers %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Style) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(ABVStyle = mean(ABV, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(Style, ABVStyle) 
```
### Compute Mean IBU by Style
```{r Question3IBUStyle}
IBUByStyle <- Beers %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Style) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(IBUStyle = as.integer(round(mean(IBU, na.rm = TRUE), 0))) %>% 
  select(Style, IBUStyle) 
```
### Substitute mean IBU and ABV style data for missing data
```{r Question3}
BeerAndBreweryImproved <- BeerAndBrewery %>% 
  inner_join(ABVByStyle, by = "Style") %>% 
  inner_join(IBUByStyle, by = "Style") %>% 
  mutate(ABV = coalesce(ABV, ABVStyle)) %>%
  mutate(IBU = coalesce(IBU, IBUStyle))
```
After missing data was filled in 0 beers have missing ABU content and 51 beers are missing an IBU rating.

## Question 4 : Plot medain alcohol content and IBU rating by state

### Summarize and enhance data for plot
```{r Question4DataManipulation}
BeerAndBreweryImprovedByState <- BeerAndBreweryImproved %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(State) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(StateABVMean = mean(ABV, na.rm = TRUE), StateABVMedian = median(ABV, na.rm = TRUE), 
                   StateIBUMean = mean(IBU, na.rm = TRUE), StateIBUMedian = median(IBU, na.rm = TRUE),
                   StateBeerCount = n()) %>% 
  select(State, StateABVMean, StateABVMedian, StateIBUMean, StateIBUMedian, StateBeerCount) 

BeerAndBreweryImprovedByState$StateABVMeanPercent <- BeerAndBreweryImprovedByState$StateABVMean * 100.0
BeerAndBreweryImprovedByState$StateABVMedianPercent <- BeerAndBreweryImprovedByState$StateABVMedian * 100.0
```
### Plot the data
```{r Question4Plot, fig.height = 10, fig.width=8}
scaleFactor = 0.1

ggplot(data = BeerAndBreweryImprovedByState, aes(x=State,  width=.4)) +
  geom_col(aes(y=StateABVMedianPercent), fill="blue") +
  geom_col(aes(y=StateIBUMedian * scaleFactor), fill="red", position = position_nudge(x = -.4)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Median percent ABV by State", breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6),
                     sec.axis=sec_axis(~./scaleFactor, name="Median IBU by State", breaks = c(0,10,20,30,40,50,60))) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x.top=element_text(color="red"),
    axis.text.x.top=element_text(color="red"),
    axis.title.x.bottom=element_text(color="blue"),
    axis.text.x.bottom=element_text(color="blue")
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = rev(levels(BeerAndBreweryImprovedByState$State)))
```

## Question 5 : States with the highest ABV and IBU
Unsure of exactly what is being asked. Do we need the state with the highest median ABV and IBU respectively or the states with the beer that has the highest ABV and IBU. The question was worked both ways

### State with the highest median ABV percent
```{r Question5MaxMedianABV}
BeerAndBreweryImprovedByState[which.max(BeerAndBreweryImprovedByState$StateABVMedian),] %>% select(State, StateABVMedianPercent)
```

### State with the highest median IBU rating
```{r Question5MaxMedianIBU}
BeerAndBreweryImprovedByState[which.max(BeerAndBreweryImprovedByState$StateIBUMedian),] %>% select(State, StateIBUMedian)
```

### Highest ABV for a single beer
```{r Queswtion5MaxBeerABV}
BeerAndBreweryImproved[which.max(BeerAndBreweryImproved$ABV),] %>% select(State, Name.x, Name.y, ABV)
```

### Highest IBU for a single beer
```{r Queswtion5MaxBeerIBU}
BeerAndBreweryImproved[which.max(BeerAndBreweryImproved$IBU),] %>% select(State, Name.x, Name.y, IBU)
```

## Question 6 : Summary and comments on distribution of ABV and IBU variables
Most states have a median ABV for beers brewed of between five and six percent. Two states fall bellow that range UT and NJ, however NJ has only eight different flavors of beer being brewed in that state. Five states have a median ABV for beers brewed above six percent KY, DC, WV, NM, MI; however, DC and WV have less than ten different flavors of beer brewed in them.

## Question 7 : Discuss the relationship between IBU and ABV
The graph below shows the relationship between IBU and ABV, in general as IBU rating increase so does ABV percent. The only part of the graph that shows a flat line is with very weak beers, those having an alcohol content less than 5 percent. A plateau exists with beers near 7 percent ABV not changing in bitterness. Higher alcohol content beers, those over 8 percent, change bitterness but at a slower rate than that of beers from 5 to 6.5 percent ABV.
```{r Question7, fig.height = 6, fig.width=10, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = BeerAndBreweryImproved, mapping = aes(x = ABV * 100, y = IBU)) +
  geom_point(position = "dodge") + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  xlab("Percent ABV") + ylab("IBU Rating") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), limits = c(2.5,10)) +
  labs(caption = "ABV values of over 10 percent were left off due to sparseness of the data")
```

## Question 8 : Investigate the differences in IBU and ABV between Ales and IPAs
First step is classifying the beers as IPA or Ale
```{r Question8}
BeerAndBreweryImproved$Classify <- "Other"
IsAleBool <- str_detect(BeerAndBreweryImproved$Name.y, regex("\\bAle\\b", ignore_case = TRUE)) & #Ale is a word
            str_detect(BeerAndBreweryImproved$Name.y, regex("\\bIPA\\b|India Pale Ale", ignore_case = TRUE), negate = TRUE) #But does not include IPA

IsIPABool <- str_detect(BeerAndBreweryImproved$Name.y, regex("\\bIPA\\b|India Pale Ale", ignore_case = TRUE))

BeerAndBreweryImproved[IsAleBool,]$Classify <- "Ale"
BeerAndBreweryImproved[IsIPABool,]$Classify <- "IPA"

# now add it for Style
IsAleBool <- str_detect(BeerAndBreweryImproved$Style, regex("\\bAle\\b", ignore_case = TRUE)) & #Ale is a word
  str_detect(BeerAndBreweryImproved$Style, regex("\\bIPA\\b|India Pale Ale", ignore_case = TRUE), negate = TRUE) #But does not include IPA

IsIPABool <- str_detect(BeerAndBreweryImproved$Style, regex("\\bIPA\\b|India Pale Ale", ignore_case = TRUE))

BeerAndBreweryImproved[IsAleBool,]$Classify <- "Ale"
BeerAndBreweryImproved[IsIPABool,]$Classify <- "IPA"
```

### Plot of IBU versus ABV for IPAs and Ales

```{r PlotIBUABV, fig.height = 6, fig.width=10, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = BeerAndBreweryImproved[!BeerAndBreweryImproved$Classify == 'Other',],
       mapping = aes(x = ABV * 100, y = IBU)) +
  geom_point(position = "dodge", mapping = aes(color = Classify)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, mapping = aes(color = Classify)) +
  xlim(2.5, 10) + xlab("Percent ABV") + ylab("IBU Rating")
```

### Scale and Filter data

The IBU rating and ABV percentage data needs to be scaled and filtered before the kNN model is created

```{r ScaleFilter}
BeerAndBreweryImproved <- BeerAndBreweryImproved %>% filter(!is.na(IBU))
BeerAndBreweryImproved$zABV = scale(BeerAndBreweryImproved$ABV)
BeerAndBreweryImproved$zIBU = scale(BeerAndBreweryImproved$IBU)

BeerAndBreweryImproved2 = BeerAndBreweryImproved %>%
  filter(Classify != 'Other')

splitPerc = .7
```

### Hyperparameter tuning for kNN Model
The optimal "k" value for the model was calculated with the following code. The code takes 5 minutes to run so is set to not run by default (eval = FALSE), Change the eval parameter to "TRUE" to run the code block. The results of this code chunk indicates an optimal "k" value of 26 which results in a mean accuracy of 89.4%

```{r OptimzekNN, fig.height = 6, fig.width=10, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
iterations = 500
numks = 60

masterAcc = matrix(nrow = iterations, ncol = numks)

for(j in 1:iterations)
{
  trainIndices = sample(1:dim(BeerAndBreweryImproved2)[1],round(splitPerc * dim(BeerAndBreweryImproved2)[1]))
  train = BeerAndBreweryImproved2[trainIndices,]
  test = BeerAndBreweryImproved2[-trainIndices,]
  for(i in 1:numks)
  {
    classifications = knn(train[,c('zABV','zIBU')], test[,c('zABV','zIBU')], train$Classify, k = i)
    table(classifications,test$Classify)
    CM = confusionMatrix(table(classifications,test$Classify))
    masterAcc[j,i] = CM$overall[1]
  }
  
}

MeanAcc = colMeans(masterAcc)

plot(seq(1,numks,1),MeanAcc, type = "l", main = "Hyperparameter Optimization", xlab = "Number of k's", ylab = "Mean Accuracy")

which.max(MeanAcc)
max(MeanAcc)

```

### Run kNN model with "k" = 11
Ouput tables and confusion matrix

```{r kNNModel}
trainIndices = sample(1:dim(BeerAndBreweryImproved2)[1],round(splitPerc * dim(BeerAndBreweryImproved2)[1]))
BeerAndBreweryImprovedTrain2 = BeerAndBreweryImproved2[trainIndices,]
BeerAndBreweryImprovedTest2 = BeerAndBreweryImproved2[-trainIndices,]
BeerClassify <- knn(BeerAndBreweryImprovedTrain2[,c('zABV','zIBU')], BeerAndBreweryImprovedTest2[,c('zABV','zIBU')], BeerAndBreweryImprovedTrain2$Classify, k = 11, prob = TRUE)
#table(BeerClassify,BeerAndBreweryImprovedTest2$Classify)
cm <- confusionMatrix(table(BeerClassify,BeerAndBreweryImprovedTest2$Classify))
print(as.matrix(cm))
```

## Question 9 Create our own answers

### Analysis by region examining ABV and IBU using ANOVA
Five regions were created by grouping the states into them. An ANOVA(ANalysis Of VAriance) was performed by region. This test looks for statistically significant differences in IBU and ABV by region.

### Create the regions

```{r ANOVAregion, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
averageABV = BeerAndBreweryImproved %>% 
  group_by(State) %>% 
  summarize(ABV = mean(ABV), IBU = mean(IBU))

west = BeerAndBreweryImproved %>% 
  filter(str_trim(State, side = c("both")) %in% c('WA','OR','CA','NV','ID','MT','WY','CO','NM','AZ','UT','AL','HI')) %>%
  mutate(region = 'W')

midwest = BeerAndBreweryImproved %>% 
  filter(str_trim(State, side = c("both")) %in% c('ND','SD', 'NE', 'KS','MN','IA','MO','WI','IL','IN','MI','OH')) %>%
  mutate(region = 'MW')

southwest = BeerAndBreweryImproved %>% 
  filter(str_trim(State, side = c("both")) %in% c('AZ','NM','OK','TX')) %>%
  mutate(region = 'SW')

southeast = BeerAndBreweryImproved %>% 
  filter(str_trim(State, side = c("both")) %in% c('AK','LA','MA','AL','TN','KY','GA','WV','VA','NC','SC','FL')) %>%
  mutate(region = 'SE')

northeast = BeerAndBreweryImproved %>% 
  filter(str_trim(State, side = c("both")) %in% c('ME','NH','VT','MA','CT','RI','NJ','NY','PA')) %>%
  mutate(region = 'NE')

USregions = rbind(west,midwest,southwest,southeast,northeast)
USregions$region = as.factor(USregions$region)
```

### ANOVA of ABV percent
While the mean alcohol content does vary by region the results of comparing region by region fall short of a statisticall significant.

```{r ABVANOVABxplt, fig.height = 6, fig.width=10}
ggboxplot(USregions, x = "region", y = "ABV", 
          ylab = "ABV", xlab = "region") + ggtitle("ABV percent by region")
abvModel = aov(ABV~region, data = USregions)
abvTukey = TukeyHSD(abvModel)
abvpvals <- abvTukey$region[,4]
```

Four relation ships come near to 95% siginifigance NE-MW, W-NE, SE-MW, W-SE

```{r ABVANOVA}
sort(abvpvals)
```

### ANOVA of IBU rating
While the mean alcohol content does vary by region the results of comparing region by region fall short of a statisticall significant.

```{r IBUBxplt}
ggboxplot(USregions, x = "region", y = "IBU", 
          ylab = "IBU", xlab = "region") + ggtitle("IBU rating by region")
IBUModel = aov(IBU~region, data = USregions)
ibuTukey <- TukeyHSD(IBUModel)
ibupvals <- ibuTukey$region[,4]

```
### IBU rating does have a statistically significant difference between regions
The difference in IBU rating between the "W" and "MW" regions is statistically significantly p-Value = 0.0127

```{r IBUANOVA}
sort(ibupvals)

```
### IBU rating versus ABV percentage by style
Here we see beers IBU rating versus ABV percent for each style. Style was determined by examing beer names and styles for key words.

```{r Styleplot, fig.height = 8, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
styles = c("Lager","Pilsner","Stout","Porter","Weissbier","Bock","Bitter","Hefeweizen","Oktoberfest","Tripel","Witbier")

for(i in 1:length(styles)){
  style = str_trim(styles[i], side = c("both"))
  styleRegex = paste("\\b", style, "\\b", sep="")
  # Name
  IsStyleBoolName <- str_detect(BeerAndBreweryImproved$Name.y, regex(styleRegex, ignore_case = TRUE))
  #BeerAndBreweryImproved[IsStyleBool,]$Classify <- style
  # Style
  IsStyleBoolStyle <- str_detect(BeerAndBreweryImproved$Style, regex(styleRegex, ignore_case = TRUE))
  BeerAndBreweryImproved[IsStyleBoolName|IsStyleBoolStyle,]$Classify <- style
}

#scatter plot
BeerAndBreweryImproved %>% filter(Classify != "Other" & Classify != "Ale" & Classify != "IPA") %>% 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ABV * 100, y = IBU)) +
  geom_point(position = "dodge", mapping = aes(color = Classify)) + facet_wrap(vars(Classify), ncol = 3) +
  ggtitle("IBU rating versus ABV percent by style") +
  xlim(2.5, 10) + xlab("Percent ABV") + ylab("IBU Rating")
```

The plots above are for styles that had a significant population of beers and had not been previously examined

### Conclusion

Removing duplicates and imputing NA values were important for us to provide a more accurate analysis.  Not doing so could potentially provide analysis and models that were not as accurate.
When performing exploratory data analysis, looking at average ABV percent or IBU rating by state alone can be misleading due to small number of beers in some states.  It is important to apply a statistical procedure to see if there actually is a difference.\

For classification purposes, the kNN model was used to separate Ales from IPAs with a high degree of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, recall, and precision.  When combined with other data sources like market segmentation or sales, this model could potentially be used to help identify ale or IPA preferences in a region.\

We choose to perform an ANOVA to see if there was a difference between geographic regions in the United States based on ABV and IBUs for Ales and IPAs.  The output from the ANOVAs and Tukey HSD post hoc test show that the western region of the United States prefers beer that has a higher IBU rating; and that Alcohol content as measured by ABV percent does not show a statistically significant difference across regions. Style data can also be used to group current IBU rating and ABV percent of available beers.  This information is useful in generating profiles based on IBU and ABV that may be useful in identifying and grouping different beer styles in the future.\
