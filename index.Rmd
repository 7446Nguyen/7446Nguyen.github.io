Welcome to my collection of projects featuring data science tools and techniques!  I hope to use this a a repositiory for quick access and reference for projects that I complete here at SMU's MSDS program.

For DS6306 Doing Data Science, please see the end of the "Micro Brewery EDA" RMarkDown for the link to the Shiny app or click here: https://7446nguyen.shinyapps.io/portfolio/

*NOTE: For the Shiny App to function, Beers.CSV and Breweries.CSV from Project 1 need to be loaded into the app.
